# Mechanical_Practice

Author: Wolf Chen

  We build this document to control our custom robot which we designed in a class 'Mechanical Practice'.
  We connect servo motors to Arduino, connet Arduino to ROS with rosserial, use Moveit! assistant to build our robot Moveit! model, and publish the position information in /move_group/fake_controller_joint_states to rosserial.
